# Default configuration for tcm-piv
#
# Notes:
# - This file is packaged with the library and provides fallbacks.
# - User configs override these values.
# - Per-pass parameters may be a scalar (broadcast) or a list of length `nr_passes`.
#
# Maintenance:
# - Treat this file as the single source of truth for defaults.
#   The Python loader merges user config over these defaults and should not
#   duplicate defaults in code.
# - Keep tables only one level deep (e.g. `[section] key = value`).
# - TOML has no `null`. Use empty string "" as “not provided” for optional paths.
# - For “tuple-like” values, use arrays like `[w, h]`; for per-pass tuple values,
#   use arrays-of-arrays like `[[w, h], [w2, h2], ...]`.
